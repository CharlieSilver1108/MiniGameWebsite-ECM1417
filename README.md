### About:
This is an individual project, completed as an assignment for a Year 1 Module at the University of Exeter, using full-stack development. It was completed via use of a Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine.

### The Project Description:
In this assignment you will deploy a LAMP stack web server to your Azure VM and design a website that enables a mini-game to be played in a browser called Pairs. 'Pairs' is a memory game that is played by selecting pairs of cards that are face down on the table. The game will display 10 'cards' (5 pairs) and the emoji images on the cards will be generated by combining features (colour, smile and eyes) randomly for each run of the game. The game should record the number of points and time taken. Points are calculated based on how many attempts and how much time the user takes to match all cards.

## Other:
Other features are available such as user profiles (including nickname and avatar), a leaderboard, and a landing page for the website.

The project is built using HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and PHP.
